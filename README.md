# Boggle_boggles_back
Boggle revisited. I've found an old version of boggle and I wish to revisit it for a 3rd time, having improved my programming knowledge greatly.
This is essentially a newer version of an old application I made a few years ago, when I started programming and revisited
again last year. I want to take what I worked on last year and improve it further.

Unfortunately, because I've only now taken up versioning of software, my earlier versions were wiped in a machine reformat!
A good reason to start versioning I say!

God bless github

I'm hoping to, in this iteration explore different ways of searching (bubble search etc) and implement boggle within a 2D array,
with the ability to search neighbouring cells within the 2D array. this ties in nicely with the game of life I'm creating
in another project.
